Win32 shell extension for perl files
------------------------------------
version 0.02
(previously called pod2html_shellext)

Run install.bat to add pretty icons to your .pl, .plx, .cgi, .pm and
.pod files. ShellNew items will be added for .pl and .cgi extensions
(that is mouse Right-Click-New-PL File).
In addition to that "POD to HTML" shell extension will be added
to .pm and .pod files.

So, you could convert pod 2 html with just two mouse clicks.

Wow!

Not "Wow"? Well, I've found this handy.

You'll need my Win32::LFN module for this shell extension to run
unless your perl has Win32::GetLongPathName built-in function
(ActiveState ActivePerl after build 514 or new 5.6 release).

install.bat is safe to run multiple times if you want to change icons.
BTW - if somebody can make pretty icons - I'd be glad to replace mine.

If you want to change the underlying pod2html behavior -
read the docs inside your pod2html.bat and make changes in p2h_auto.bat
(that is in your <perl>/bin after the installation) or in p2h_auto.b_t
in this distribution. The default options are --noindex, --netscape

If your .pl and other extensions are already associated with some
applications it's much likely that this addition will not break those
settings.

This package was successfully tested on Win95, Win98, Win2000 Pro.

NOTE: on some systems (if not always) your .pl and .cgi extensions
should be associated with some program (like perl.exe or Notepad
or whatever) for ShellNew to work. If you have no such an association
you can't run CGI application under some local server as we usually
do for testing.
So, in Windows Explorer open View|Options or Tools|Folder Options
(depending on your Windows version), go to the "File Types" pane
and associate "CGI file" and "PL File" types - add new action, for
example:
"Open"
"c:\perl\bin\perl.exe" "%1"

NOTE2: you can always edit the perl-template.pl file that is in your
<perl>\icons\ directory. After the installation it contains almost
nothing. You can add your personal info or CVS vars or whatever.
In order to make a separate template for CGI files you can edit
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cgi\ShellNew\FileName string in your registry.


Enjoy!
